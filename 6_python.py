# operators in python 



'''-> Arithmetic operators ''' 
print(5+6) # addition operator 
print(10-7) # subtraction operator 
print(5*8) # multiplication operator 
print(7/2) # division operator 
print(11//2) # division by zero / floor division operator 
print(10%2) # modulation operator 
print(10**2) # exponentiation operator 

''' assignment operators '''
a=5; #assignment operator
a+=1 # addition and assignment operator
a-=1  #subtraction operator and assignment operator 
a*=2;# multiplication operator and assignment operator
a//=2;# division operator and assignment operator
a%=2;# modulo operator and assignment
a**=3 ; #exponential  operator and assignment
a&=1; #bitwise and operator and assignment operator 
a|=1 # bitwise or operator and assignment operator 
a^=4 #bitwise xor operator and assignment operator
a>>=1 # bitwise right shift operator and assignment operator
a<<=1 # bitwise left shift operator and assignment operator

''' comparision operators '''
print(1==1) #equal to operator 
print(5<3) # greater than
print(1<-1)#less than operator 
print(5<=5) # less than equal to operator 
print(4>=9) # greater than equal to 
print(4!=4)

''''logical operators '''
# and return true if both statements are true 
# or return true of any of the statemet is true 
# not convert the true into false 


'identity operator '
# is if id of var a == to id of var b 
# is not  vice versa 


'''membership operator '''
# in if value exist in the object 


'''bit wise operators '''
# & bitwise ad sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 
# | 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^  xor invert the all bits and find or Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ not invert the all bits 
# << left shift 
# >> right shift
