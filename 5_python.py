# variables are the basic the data member in the python they are used to store some data in python 
# python is a dynamic programming language so it do not need to define the data type at the begning 
# all things are in python are the python object 
# a=1 a is stored in a memeory location 

# -> variable is a container to hold the data , creating a vairbale is similar to creating a place in a memory to stroe some data 
a=1#int 
a="radha"# string 
a=1.55 # double 
a=True # boolean
a=None #None similar to null of other languages 
complexNumber=complex(5,5)# complex data type in python 
a=["radhika ","sonam",'prahi',"mahak"] #list it can store the values of different different data types , you can mutate the value in it 
a=("radhika","kishor","vrajrani") # tuupple , you cant mutate the value in it 
a={'name':'sonam','class':6,'age':12}
# type function is used to  get the type in python 

# in a python you cant add int with the string 
print(type(a))
# it will return in the format of class beacuase the class and data types are the object
