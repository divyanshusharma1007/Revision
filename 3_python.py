# modules -> they are just a python code writtern by someone . we will use them to write our program fast and quick .
# there are two types of moudles in python #
# ~built in module -> modules which already come with python are called as the built in modules 
# ~ external modules -> moduules written by someone else and you install them for writing your code are called the external modules 
# external modules are installed with the help if this tools . 
# - >conda 
# -> pip 

# simple code of installing the modules 
# pip install numpy 
# pip install pyttsx3

# you can also create your own modules in python 

# when you tries to import any module first of all it will check on the current directory 
# after it will see on the installed directory 
# so you have to avoid the creating the name of files as the module name
